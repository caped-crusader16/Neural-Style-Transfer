# Neural-Style-Transfer
This work presents a neural algorithm of artistic style, known as Style Transfer, that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks. This work provides insights into the deep image representations learned by different Convolutional Neural Network architectures viz. VGG- 16, VGG-19, and ResNet50
